Web-Visualizer for Eyetracking Data
===================================
2011 by Erik Weitnauer

Prerequisites
-------------
* node.js (v0.4.2) installed
* .asc eyetracking data files only containing events in the ./DATA directory
  (use edf2asc.exe with the -e option for converting the .edf files from the
   tracker)
* image files in the ./IMAGES directory

How to use
----------
1. Visualization
Start a static file server on the local machine by calling
  >node node_static_server.js
in your shell. Then browse to the address http://localhost:8888/ in a modern
web browser.

2. Data Extraction
The scripts node_write_fix_times.js, node_write_left_fraction.js and
node_write_times.js can be run with node to extract the respective data from
the .asc files and write them into csv-files. In these files, each column
represents a person and each row a problem.
